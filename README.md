# roman-numerals-kata

### The Kata:

```
In whatever language you prefer, write a class that implements the
following interface (example given in Java):


public interface RomanNumeralGenerator {

    public String generate(int number);

}

For example, see the following sample inputs and outputs:

1 = “I”
5 = “V”
10 = “X”
20 = “XX”
3999 = “MMMCMXCIX”

Caveat: Only support numbers between 1 and 3999
```
